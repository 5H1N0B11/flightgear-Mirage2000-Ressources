presentation
============

open with GIMP the file Mirage2000/Models/texture.xcf.gz

you can see 2 main parts (look at screenshot create_liveries_presentation_groups_of_layers.png) :
- the group "mirage2000_base"
- groups "*-camo_*"

the group "mirage2000_base"
---------------------------
it contents all layers which are common and required for the 2000 :
- textures,
- salissures (soil),
- profil√©s,
- marquages
All theese layers are regrouped. It permits to simplify the displaying of all layers in one time.
When you export a png to create a new livery, don't forget to display this group.

groups "*-camo_*"
-----------------
there is on per camouflage, each one contents 4 layers
- radar
- intrados
- 2 colors of extrados

example :
- 1-camo_brun-sable
- 3-camo_gris-vert

warning, the mirage 2000 has at least 2 different camos, the marks have not the same shape :
- type N (grey and green) : 
- type C (blue and grey)



using and editing to create a new livery
========================================

The main idea is to avoid painting "hand-drawn" the marks with the new colors you've chosen.
But to create a new livery in few clicks.

To create a new livery
- duplicate a group "*-camo_*", 
- hide the other layers and groups
- then, for each layer (radar, intrados, extrados) of the new group, use the tool "colorize" and set the values "Hue", "Saturation", "Lightness" in order to obtain the wanted color.
- after that, display the group "mirage2000_base" and export  the image in png format

(look at screenshot create_liveries_colorize.png)
